                                <li>Client/User testing is only implemented at the testing stage, so any serious issues accrued previously will not be identified until this stage, which can sverely delay projects incurring heavy costs and waste of time</li>
                                <li>It is not until late in development that any working software is released, so getting an accurate idea of how a project is developing previous to this is difficult</li>
